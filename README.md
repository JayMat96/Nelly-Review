### Summary
In *Nelly*, you control a little girl named Nelly as she navigates through a nightmare fairytale world she stumbled in to. To help Nelly make it back home, you must solve puzzles. Some of these puzzles can be solved with the help of your newly acquired special abilities.

### Final Thoughts
*Nelly* is a very short game. There are only eight levels with the final level simply having you walk to your house a few yards away. I did have fun with the game. The way the game taught you the controls was great, and I found the special abilites as unique and fun. The game plays out in Black and White, giving the game a slight eerie tone.

There is not much to complain about with *Nelly*. The controls felt stiff and the game was too short. One thing I found odd, was in the second level of the game. In the beginning of the second level, there is a tree with a face placed on the same plane as Nelly. I tried interacting with the tree, but nothing happened. Perhaps the tree was planned to do or say something, but the programer was not able to put in whatever action this was.

There are parts of *Nelly* that I liked. Instead of having to read a wall of text in the beginning, the game would block your path and tell you how to get past the obstacle. As you progress through the game, Nelly gains two special abilites. The abilities are explained as soon as you get them, but it is up to the player to know where to use these abilities and which one to use. The abilities have a short cooldown period allowing the player to use the abilities quicker, while also preventing the player from constantly using the abilities. Nelly's respawn time was short and the checkpoints were plentiful, so the player could quickly go back to where they left off.

Overall, the game was fun, but extremely short. I played for about 30 minutes before beating the game. I would love if the game was expanded upon. However, the game was published in March of 2012. If a sequel or expansion has not been created yet, I'm not sure if there is going to be one.
